\begin{abstract}
We study the problem of efficient online multiclass linear classification with
bandit feedback, where all examples belong to one of $K$ classes and lie in the
$d$-dimensional Euclidean space. Previous works have left open the challenge of
designing efficient algorithms with finite mistake bounds when the data is
linearly separable by a margin $\gamma$. In this work, we take a first step
towards this problem. We consider two notions of linear separability,
\emph{strong} and \emph{weak}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Under the strong linear separability condition, we design an efficient
algorithm that achieves a near-optimal mistake bound of
$O\left( K/\gamma^2 \right)$.

\item Under the more challenging weak linear separability condition, we design
an efficient algorithm with a mistake bound of $\min (2^{\widetilde{O}(K \log^2
(1/\gamma))}, 2^{\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{1/\gamma} \log K)})$.\footnote{We use the
notation $\widetilde{O}(f(\cdot)) = O(f(\cdot) \polylog(f(\cdot)))$.} Our
algorithm is based on kernel Perceptron and is inspired by the work of
\citet{Klivans-Servedio-2008} on improperly learning intersection of halfspaces.
\end{enumerate}
